Issues on GitHub are only related to problems of Swagger-Core itself. We'll try to offer support here for your use case, but we can't offer help with projects that use Swagger-Core, like Springfox.
 
Likewise, we can't accept features or bugs in the Swagger/OpenAPI specifications themselves, or anything that violates the specifications.
